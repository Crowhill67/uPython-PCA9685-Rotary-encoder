"""
In this case you are accessing servo(0) on board srv1. By rights it would be handier to name this object pca1, pca2 etc., then access the servos wiyh
pca1.position(0, us = 'value here')
pca1.position(1, us = 'value here')
Then for a second board:
create an object for the board:
pca2=servo.Servos(i2c,address=0x41,freq=50, min_us=510, max_us=2300, degrees=180)
and access it's servos by:
pca2.position(0, us = 'value here')
pca2.position(1, us = 'value here')

There must be a cool way of mapping the servo's to the boars, so you can access them directly. Maybe look at Mitri's documentation on the hexapod.
